# How to install Python and start up `jupyter` notebooks.

## What is Python?

### The asnwer, from `python.org`

> Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.

### Why are we using Python?

Python is one of the most widely used coding languages with thousands of useful softwares (or packages) based on the Python programming language. Part of the reason why it is a popular choice for engineers is large collection of online users and because of powerful analysis packages such as `numpy`, `scipy`, and `matplotlib` (which will be used in this course). These tools will allow us to work with large amounts of reactor data, solve ODEs, plot the results, and generate models for reactors.

### What is `jupyter` and why are we using it? 

Jupyter (pronounced like the planet) is a web application that allows users to run and visualize code. It easily allows for users to write code and text, perform calculations, generate plots, and save the results as PDF, python (`.py`), Jupyter (`.ipynb`) or HTML formats. We will be using this when writing code, generating plots, and doing excercises.
